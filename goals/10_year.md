## The Purpose of a 10-Year Vision

Ten years is far enough to dream big, but close enough that your choices today matter. This isn't a detailed plan—it's a direction. A north star for goal-setting.

Your 10-year vision should:
- Be ambitious enough to feel slightly unrealistic
- Be specific enough to guide major decisions
- Connect to your deepest values
- Evolve as you learn more about what you want
