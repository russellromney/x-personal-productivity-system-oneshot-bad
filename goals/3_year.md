## The Purpose of 3-Year Goals

Three years is long enough to accomplish something significant, but short enough to plan concretely. This is not a wish list—it's a directional document that shapes your annual goals.

Your 3-year goals should:
- Be ambitious enough to excite you
- Be concrete enough to measure progress
- Connect to your 10-year vision
- Guide your annual goal-setting
