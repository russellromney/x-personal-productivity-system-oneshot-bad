# Life Map

*Adapted from Alex Lieberman's Life Map framework*

The Life Map is a structured assessment of six life domains. It helps you see where you're thriving, where you're neglecting, and where the gaps are between what you want and what you have.

Most CEOs are strong in one or two domains and neglecting the rest. This framework forces honest acknowledgment of the full picture.

---

## The Six Domains

1. **Career** — Work, professional growth, impact, building things
2. **Relationships** — Partner, family, friends, community
3. **Health** — Physical fitness, mental health, energy, longevity
4. **Meaning** — Purpose, contribution, legacy, spirituality
5. **Finances** — Income, wealth, security, freedom
6. **Fun** — Joy, adventure, play, experiences

These domains are interconnected but distinct. Excellence in one cannot compensate for neglect of another.

## Part 1: Current State Assessment

For each domain, score yourself 1-10 and explain why.

**Scoring Guide:**
- 1-3: Crisis or severe neglect
- 4-5: Below where you want to be
- 6-7: Acceptable but room to grow
- 8-9: Strong, minor improvements possible
- 10: Peak—this domain is exactly where you want it
