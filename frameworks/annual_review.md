# Annual Review Framework

*Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review methodology*

This framework provides a structured approach to reflecting on the past year and preparing for the next one. It's designed to surface patterns, celebrate wins, acknowledge failures, and extract lessons that compound over time.

---

## When to Use This

Complete this framework once per year, ideally in late December or early January. Block 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time. Do it somewhere you can think clearly—not at your desk, not with your phone buzzing.
