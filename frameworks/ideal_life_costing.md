# Ideal Lifestyle Costing

*Adapted from Tim Ferriss's lifestyle design methodology*

Most people never calculate what their ideal life actually costs. They assume it's astronomical, so they never pursue it. Or they chase arbitrary wealth targets ("I need $10 million") without connecting those numbers to anything real.

This framework changes that. You'll define your ideal lifestyle in specific terms, attach real costs, and discover your actual "freedom number"—the income required to live exactly as you want.

The result is usually surprising: your ideal life costs less than you think, which means freedom is closer than you realize.

## The Philosophy

**The goal is lifestyle design, not wealth maximization.**

Money is a means to an end. The end is how you spend your time and who you spend it with. Once you know your number, you can make cleaner decisions about how hard to push, what opportunities to pursue, and when enough is enough.

## Part 1: Current Reality

Before designing your ideal, understand your present.

### Monthly Expenses (Current)

| Category | Current Monthly Cost |
|----------|---------------------|

| Business expenses (if personal) | $[PLACEHOLDER] |
| Other | $[PLACEHOLDER] |
| **Total Monthly** | **$[PLACEHOLDER]** |
| **Annual (x12)** | **$[PLACEHOLDER]** |

## Part 2: Ideal Lifestyle Definition

### The Dream Design

Describe your ideal lifestyle in specific terms. Not "more travel" but "two weeks in Japan, one month working remotely from Europe, long weekends monthly."

**Where do you live?**
[PLACEHOLDER: Be specific. City? Neighborhood? Type of home? Own or rent?]

**What does a typical week look like?**
[PLACEHOLDER: How many hours do you work? What do you do with your free time? Who do you see?]

**What do you do for fun?**
[PLACEHOLDER: Hobbies, activities, experiences you want regularly?]

**How do you travel?**
[PLACEHOLDER: How often? Where? What class of travel? What type of accommodation?]

**What services do you want?**
[PLACEHOLDER: House cleaning, meal prep, assistant, trainer, etc.?]

**What do you want to own?**
[PLACEHOLDER: Home, car, equipment, art, etc.?]

**What do you want to give?**
[PLACEHOLDER: Charity, supporting family, mentoring?]

## Part 3: Ideal Lifestyle Costing

Now attach real numbers to your ideal lifestyle. Research actual costs. Don't guess—look things up.

### Monthly Expenses (Ideal)

| Category | Ideal Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Housing | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Specific description] |
| Food | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Groceries + dining pattern] |
| Transportation | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: What car? What commute?] |
| Health | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Insurance, gym, trainer, etc.] |
| Personal | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Clothing budget, grooming, etc.] |
| Entertainment | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Events, hobbies, streaming, etc.] |
| Relationship | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Dates, gifts, trips together] |
| Travel (amortized monthly) | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Annual travel budget ÷ 12] |
| Giving | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Charity, family support] |
| Savings/Investments | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Target savings rate] |
| Services | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Cleaning, assistant, etc.] |
| "Dream" purchases (amortized) | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Big purchases spread monthly] |
| Buffer (10-20%) | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER: Life surprises you] |
| **Total Monthly** | **$[PLACEHOLDER]** | |
| **Annual (x12)** | **$[PLACEHOLDER]** | |

## Part 4: The Math

### Your Freedom Number

**Ideal annual expenses:** $[PLACEHOLDER]
**Required gross income (estimate 40% to taxes):** $[PLACEHOLDER] (annual expenses ÷ 0.6)
**This is your Freedom Number:** $[PLACEHOLDER]

### The Gap Analysis

**Current income:** $[PLACEHOLDER]
**Freedom Number:** $[PLACEHOLDER]
**Gap (or surplus):** $[PLACEHOLDER]

If there's a gap:
- How long until your income reaches your Freedom Number?
- What would accelerate closing the gap?
- What parts of your ideal lifestyle could you have now?

If there's a surplus:
- Why aren't you living your ideal lifestyle already?
- What's actually holding you back? (It's not money)

---

## Part 5: Dream Income (Stretch Version)

The Freedom Number is sufficiency. Now calculate abundance.

What's the income that would let you:
- Help family members financially
- Give generously to causes you care about
- Never think about money day-to-day
- Take risks without financial fear

**Dream Income Number:** $[PLACEHOLDER]

How does this compare to your Freedom Number? The gap between "enough" and "abundance" reveals what you'd do with more.

---

## Part 6: Time vs. Money Tradeoffs

The real question isn't just "how much?" but "how much for how much time?"

**How many hours per week do you want to work?**
[PLACEHOLDER]

**What's your ideal hourly rate?** (Freedom Number ÷ 50 weeks ÷ ideal weekly hours)
$[PLACEHOLDER]

**What's your current effective hourly rate?** (Current income ÷ actual hours worked)
$[PLACEHOLDER]

This reframes the question: it's not about making more money, it's about making enough money with the time allocation you want.

---

## Part 7: What You Can Have Now

Your ideal life isn't all-or-nothing. What components could you have today?

| Ideal Component | Cost | Could Have Now? | What's Stopping You? |
|-----------------|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [PLACEHOLDER] | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [Yes/No] | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| [PLACEHOLDER] | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [Yes/No] | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| [PLACEHOLDER] | $[PLACEHOLDER] | [Yes/No] | [PLACEHOLDER] |

The things stopping you are usually not money. They're permission, identity, or fear of change.

---

## Part 8: The Minimums

What's the minimum lifestyle you'd be satisfied with? Not miserable—satisfied.

**Minimum Monthly Number:** $[PLACEHOLDER]
**Minimum Annual Number:** $[PLACEHOLDER]

This is your "floor"—the runway calculation for taking risks. If everything falls apart, this is survival mode.

The range between your minimum and your freedom number is where life happens.

---

## Part 9: Key Insights

### What Surprised You?

[PLACEHOLDER: What did you learn from this exercise?]

### What Can You Change Today?

[PLACEHOLDER: What immediate adjustments would move you toward your ideal?]

### What Beliefs Need to Shift?

[PLACEHOLDER: What assumptions about money, lifestyle, or possibility were challenged?]

---

## Review Schedule

- **Quarterly:** Review expenses vs. ideal (are you on track?)
- **Annually:** Recalculate ideal lifestyle costs (preferences change, prices change)
- **Major life changes:** Full recalculation (new city, new relationship, new company stage)

---

## The Point

This isn't about budgeting. It's about clarity.

When you know your number, you can:
- Say no to opportunities that don't move you toward it
- Say yes to calculated risks because you know your floor
- Stop chasing abstract "more" and pursue specific "enough"
- Make decisions from clarity, not anxiety
