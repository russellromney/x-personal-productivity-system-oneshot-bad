# Vivid Vision

*Inspired by the Tony Robbins tradition of detailed future visualization*

A Vivid Vision is a detailed written description of your life 3 years from now, written as if it's already happened. It's not a goal list—it's an immersive narrative that makes your future feel real enough to pull you toward it.

---

## Why This Works

Your brain doesn't clearly distinguish between vivid imagination and memory. When you write a detailed description of your future life and revisit it regularly, you:
- Clarify what you actually want (not what you think you should want)
- Make decisions easier (does this choice move toward the vision or away from it?)
- Notice opportunities you would otherwise miss
- Build conviction that sustains you through hard seasons

This is not magical thinking. It's strategic clarity.

## How to Write Your Vivid Vision

### The Setup

1. Block 2 hours of uninterrupted time
2. Go somewhere you can think—not your office, not your home
3. Put your phone away
4. Write in present tense ("I am..." not "I will be...")
5. Include sensory details—what do you see, feel, hear?
6. Be specific enough that you'd recognize it when you arrive
7. Write at least 1,500 words (depth reveals what you actually want)

### The Timeframe

Write about your life exactly 3 years from today. Why 3 years?
- Long enough to achieve meaningful change
- Short enough to feel real and urgent
- Concrete enough to plan backward from

### Review Rhythm
- Read it once per month (put it on your calendar)
- Read it before any major decision
- Read it when you feel lost or discouraged

### Update Rhythm
- Minor updates quarterly (details that have evolved)
- Major rewrite annually (after completing your annual review)

### Decision Filter
When facing a choice, ask: "Does this move me toward my Vivid Vision or away from it?"
