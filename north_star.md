# North Star

Your north star is your core purpose—the thing that orients everything else. It's not a goal. Goals are things you achieve and move past. Your north star is a direction you travel toward indefinitely.

## The Relationship Between North Star and Goals

Your north star is the direction. Your goals are the milestones along the way.

```
North Star (permanent direction)
    ↓
10-Year Vision (where you hope to be)
    ↓
3-Year Goals (what you're building toward)
    ↓
1-Year Goals (what you're doing now)
    ↓
Quarterly Focus (what matters this quarter)
    ↓
Weekly Priorities (what you're doing this week)
    ↓
Daily Actions (what you're doing today)
```

Everything should ladder up. If a goal doesn't connect to your north star, question why you're pursuing it.

## When Your North Star Feels Wrong

Sometimes your stated north star won't match your lived experience. That dissonance is information.

Possible causes:
- You wrote what you thought you *should* want, not what you actually want
- Your north star has genuinely shifted and you haven't updated it
- You're in a temporary season that requires different focus
- You're avoiding the harder truth about what you actually care about

Sit with the dissonance. Journal about it. Talk to someone you trust. The answer will become clear.
