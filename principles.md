# Operating Principles

These are the principles that guide how you move through the world. Not aspirations—principles. Things you actually believe and try to practice, even when it's hard.

Review these quarterly. Edit them when they no longer fit. A principle you don't follow isn't a principle; it's a wish.

## Starter Principles

*Delete, edit, or keep these based on what's true for you.*

### On Work

**Build things that matter.**
Life is short. Spend it on work that creates real value for real people. If you wouldn't be proud to explain what you built to a thoughtful stranger, reconsider what you're building.

**Speed wins, but direction matters more.**
Moving fast in the wrong direction just gets you lost faster. Take time to confirm direction, then move with urgency.

**Leverage is everything.**
One hour of strategic thinking can save a hundred hours of execution. One right hire can multiply your output tenfold. Always ask: where is the leverage?

**Say no by default.**
Every yes is a no to something else. Protect your attention like it's your most valuable asset—because it is.

**Ship, then iterate.**
Perfection is procrastination in disguise. Get something real into the world, learn from contact with reality, and improve from there.

### On Decisions

**When in doubt, choose the path that builds optionality.**
Reversible decisions should be made quickly. Irreversible decisions deserve careful thought.

**Optimize for regret minimization.**
Ask yourself at 80: will I regret not doing this, or will I regret doing it? The answer is usually clear.

**Trust your gut on people, data on strategy.**
Your intuition about character is often right. Your intuition about markets is often wrong.

**Hard conversations now prevent harder problems later.**
Avoidance compounds. Address friction early, directly, and with respect.

### On Relationships

**Invest in people who make you better.**
You become the average of who you spend time with. Choose deliberately.

**Be honest, especially when it's uncomfortable.**
Kindness without honesty is manipulation. Honesty without kindness is cruelty. Practice both together.

**Reciprocity, not transaction.**
Give generously to people you respect without keeping score. The returns are non-linear and unpredictable.

**Protect your inner circle fiercely.**
Family, close friends, your partner—these relationships are not negotiable. Business can wait; people can't.

### On Self

**Energy management beats time management.**
You can't manufacture more hours, but you can manage your energy. Know what depletes you and what renews you.

**Clarity comes from action, not thought.**
You can't think your way to clarity. Do something, observe the results, and adjust.

**Your health is your company's health.**
If you break down, everything breaks down. Sleep, exercise, and recovery are not optional.

**Identity is a cage.**
"I'm not the kind of person who..." limits you. Stay fluid. Let your actions define you, not your labels.

### On Money

**Money is fuel, not the destination.**
Enough money buys freedom. More money often buys complexity. Know your number.

**Spend on experiences and time, not on status.**
No one on their deathbed wishes they'd bought a nicer car.

**Runway is peace of mind.**
Always know your burn rate—personal and professional. Survival enables everything else.

### On Life

**This is not a dress rehearsal.**
You get one life. Act accordingly.

**Boredom is a signal, not a flaw.**
If you're consistently bored, something is misaligned. Pay attention.

**Gratitude is a practice, not a feeling.**
It doesn't arrive on its own. You have to cultivate it.

**Leave things better than you found them.**
Relationships, organizations, rooms, conversations—improve what you touch.

## Principles in Tension

Sometimes principles conflict. Note those tensions here so you remember they're real.

**Example:** "Ship fast" vs. "Get direction right first" — These are in tension. The answer depends on context. Recognize the tradeoff.

## Principles You've Outgrown

When a principle no longer serves you, move it here instead of deleting it entirely. It's useful to remember what you used to believe.
