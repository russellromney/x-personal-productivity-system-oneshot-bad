# Future Self Interview

A guided conversation with the person you're becoming. This interview asks you to imagine yourself 5-10 years in the future and write as if that future self is advising your present self.

This isn't fantasy—it's strategic imagination. When you clarify who you're becoming, your present decisions become easier.

---

## Before You Begin

- Block 45-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Complete the Past Year Reflection and Identity interviews first if possible
- Write in first person as your future self ("I am..." "You should...")
- Be specific and concrete, not vague and aspirational
- Let yourself believe this future is possible
