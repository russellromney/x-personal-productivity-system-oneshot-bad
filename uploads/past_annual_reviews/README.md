## What to Upload

- Annual reviews from previous years
- Year-end reflections or journal entries
- Performance reviews (self or from others)

- Any structured reflection from previous years

## Supported Formats

- Markdown (.md)
- Plain text (.txt)
- PDF (will need to be read separately)
- Word documents (.doc, .docx)

## How These Will Be Used

During your annual review process, you'll reference these documents to:

1. **Find repeated goals** — What do you keep saying you'll do?
2. **Spot recurring failures** — Where do you consistently fall short?
3. **Identify hidden strengths** — What shows up again and again as a win?
4. **Recognize blind spots** — What feedback keeps surprising you?
5. **Track themes** — What threads run through your years?

## After Uploading

Once you've added documents here:

1. Read through them systematically
2. Extract patterns using the questions above
3. Add key insights to `memory.md`
4. Reference specific documents in your annual review
