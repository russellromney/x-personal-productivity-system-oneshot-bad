## What to Upload

- Journal entries
- Personal notes
- Feedback from mentors or coaches
- 360 reviews or peer feedback
- Notes from significant conversations
- Personal manifestos or declarations
- Letters to your future self
- Therapist or coach notes (if you have them)
- Articles or passages that changed your thinking
- Screenshots of meaningful messages

## How These Will Be Used

These documents create a searchable archive of your thinking over time. Reference them:

- During annual planning to see what past-you was thinking
- When you feel disconnected from your purpose
- To trace how your thinking has evolved
- To find patterns you've forgotten

## Organization Tips

You can create subfolders if helpful:
- `/notes/journal/` — Personal journal entries
- `/notes/feedback/` — Feedback from others
- `/notes/ideas/` — Business or life ideas
- `/notes/reference/` — Things you want to remember

Or keep everything flat and use search.

## Naming Convention (suggested)

`YYYY-MM-DD_brief-description.md`

Example: `2024-06-15_thoughts-after-board-meeting.md`
